		<h1>Tutorial</h1>
		<p>This tutorial shows the typical steps in doing a Genome Wide Association Mapping analysis.
		Following steps are going to be described in detail:
		<ol>
			<li>Upload phenotypes</li>
			<li>Create datasets</li>
			<li>Create transformations</li>
			<li>Run GWAS</li>
			<li>View the results</li>
			<li>Run Step-Wise GWAS</li>
		</ol>
		</p> 
		<h2>Uploading Phenotypes</h2>
		<p>
		First the user has to navigate to the phenotype-upload page via the main navigation bar. 
		In this tutorial we are going to upload a phenotype file which contains 4 different phenotypes.
		For a detailed description of the phenotype file format refer to <a href="#!helpPage;section=phenotypes;subsection=format">Phenotype Format section</a>.
		Just click on "Browse" in the upload-form and select your phenotype. <img></img>
		As soon as the phenotypes were successfully uploaded the app will switch to the Analysis page which displays the list of all phenotypes and some statistics.

		<h2> 
			Creating a subset
		</h2>
		<p>
			By clicking on a specific phenotype additional information about the selected phenotype are displayed. On this page also all subsets/datasets for the phenotype are displayed.
			Initially after uploading a phenotype a dataset called fullset whichc contains phenotype values for all accessions is created. 
			It is now possible to create subsets for specific accessions. For example if the users wants to run GWAS on a swedish subset it is possible to
